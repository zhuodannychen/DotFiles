# Neovim
I use Neovim now instead of Vim.

Inspiration from [this setup](https://gist.github.com/benawad/b768f5a5bbd92c8baabd363b7e79786f).

# Stuff I added
* Press `\y` to copy entire file
* Mapping `jk` to `<ESC>`
* Press `<F2>` to create/open input file next to current file (split window)
* Press `<F3>` to run cpp file with the input file
* Press `<F4>` to compile cpp file
* Press `<F5>` to run python3 file or (run and compile) cpp file with the input file

More languages can be supported by mapping `<F5>` correctly in `init.vim`
